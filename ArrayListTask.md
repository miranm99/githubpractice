## WrapperClass and ArrayList

1.Write a program that can verify if a password is a strong password. Characteristics of strong passwords are:
        1.1 Password must be at least have 8 characters long, and should not contain space
        1.2 PassWord should at least contain one upper case letter
        1.3 PassWord should at least contain one lower case letter
        1.4 Password should at least contain one special characters
        1.5 Password should at least contain a digit


2. RecplaceAll Task:
		2.1 Create a method named replaceAll that passes three parameters: integer array, integer oldElement, integer newElement. The method replaces all the element of the array that matching with the given old element with the given new element, and returns the new array.
			Ex:
				arr = {10, 10, 20, 30, 40, 30, 30, 30};

				replaceAll(arr, 30, 300) ==> {10, 10, 20, 300, 40, 300, 300, 300}


		2.2 Create the same functions for double arrays, char arrays, and String arrays

3. Remove all the element that has letter 'J' from the list. 
   "Java", "Python", "JavaScript", "C#", "C++", "Java", "Java"

4. In the list below remove all the that's not a palindrome
   "Anna", "Racecar", "Level", "Eye", "Java", "Python", "TechCircle"

5. Tasks
    5.1 Create an Array of string called countries
    5.2 Write a program that can remove all the country names that have length of 10 or greater

6.  write a program that can return the nth largest number from an arraylist

			arraylist = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7, 7 ,8, 8}
			n = 5

			output:
				4

7. Write a program that can find the maximum, minimum and average number from an arrayList of integers

8.  Create a class named RemoveElements:
			8.1 Create a method that passes two parametetrs: an integer array and an integer index. the method removes the element at the given index of the array and returns the new array
					Ex:
						int[] arr = {10,20,30,40}
						removeElement(arr, 2) ==> {10, 20, 40}

			8.2 Create a method that passes two parametetrs: a double array and an integer index. the method removes the element at the given index of the array and returns the new array


			8.3 Create a method that passes two parametetrs: a char array and an integer index. the method removes the element at the given index of the array and returns the new array

			8.4 Create a method that passes two parametetrs: a String array and an integer index. the method removes the element at the given index of the array and returns the new array


9. write a program that find the unique names from an arraylist of string
                names in the arraylist ==> Liam,Olivia,Emma,Sophia,James,Henry,Olivia,Emma,Sophia,James,Henry
                output = [Liam,Olivia,Emma,Sophia,James,Henry]

10. write a program that can remove the digits and letters from an array list of characters
             Arraylist ==> [1,3,a,&,d,4,2,1,d,4,0,6,7,7,f,d,w,r,3,4,!,@]
             output ==> &,!,@
        
11. Write a program that can sort and Arraylist of integer ascending order
            [3,2,1,6,5,4]

12. Write a program to get unique characterset from a string.
           String str = "aaaaabbbccccdeeeef";
           output : [a,b,c,d,e,f]
        
13. Write a program to reverse an arraylist
